               <p>For Summer 2016, I worked in a robotics edtech startup called <a href="http://roboterra.com">Roboterra</a> based in Silicon Valley.
                I designed the entire user interface of the CastleRock webapp and helped developed the frontend with 3 engineers using Electron, React.js, Redux.js and three.js.
                <br><br>
                I also eventually helped with product management jobs such as content writing, collaborating across teams, setting up an Agile environment, coding, and the like.

                   This summer was my first foray into the tech startup scene. Here I realized the potential that technology had to reach a mass of people.
                   I helped develop the product through talking with customers, forming partnerships with health professionals, developing the website, and initiating a project of my own: a mobile app. <br><br>

                I did not discover my love for technology like other 14-year olds who tore apart their computers and saw how cool
                they were. I discovered it as an 18-year old when I moved 8,207 miles away from my home and needed a means to
                connect with the place I missed most; when I realized the need for more innovation around financial solutions
                to grow small businesses in third-world economies; when, during my design obsession, I wanted
                an immediate way to learn how many post-its it took to circle the world (508,000,00 btw.)</br></br>

                I discovered it when I saw its potential to solve human problems, influence behaviors through good (or bad!)
                design, and connect millions from seemingly disparate worlds, all with a click of a button. I thrive at the
                core of tech x design x business. My biggest dream is to improve the growing tech and startup

                <li>Crave feedback - prototype, iterate, repeat. Failure is crucial to success.</li>
                <li>Data-driven - insights are drawn from asking the right questions and crafting the best stories.</li>
                <li>Empathy is core - towards users and people under your leadership. No one does it alone.</li>
