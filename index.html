      <p>Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, &ldquo;When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.&rdquo; Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act </p>
