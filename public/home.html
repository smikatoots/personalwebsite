                 <p>For Summer 2016, I worked in a robotics edtech startup called <a href="http://roboterra.com">Roboterra</a> based in Silicon Valley.
                  I designed the entire user interface of the CastleRock webapp, and a resources integration platform. I developed and deployed the frontend with 3 engineers using Electron, React.js, Redux.js and three.js. This also involved extensive research for the creation of the onboarding process of the webapp.
                  <br><br>
                  Our work contributed to maximizing the efficiency of Roboterra's 4 global offices. Our work was also used as the second version of the product Roboterra created, deployed to 3000+ teachers and students.
                  <br><br>
                  I also eventually helped with product management jobs such as content writing, collaborating across teams, setting up an Agile environment, designing implementation plans, writing specs, coding, and the like.

                     This summer was my first foray into the tech startup scene. Here I realized the potential that technology had to reach a mass of people.
                     I helped develop the product through talking with customers, forming partnerships with health professionals, developing the website, and initiating a project of my own: a mobile app. <br><br>

                 <p> I initiated a project with the CEO of a domestic airport in the Philippines. He knew that I was training with User Experience and Human-Centered Design studies
                     and wanted to find a way to improve the airport through this process. My task:
                     Use human-centered design to improve the User Experience of NAIA Terminal IV. I gathered 5 friends who were also into design, we crafted
                     a 4-day research plan and scheduled brainstorming sessions thereafter. We submitted our reports, and I'm proud to say that one year after
                     we did the design research, the airport implemented bits of our designs to improve the airport experience. <br><br>

                 <p> I wanted to bring a culture of design on campus, and also teach myself the principles of human-centered design.
                     In spring of 2015, I ended up crafting a for-credit semester-long class that taught 15 students design thinking through hands-on projects.
                     The 5 groups worked with non-profits, student organizations, and local companies.
                     One group created the entire branding system of a student organization. Another design the physical layout and space of a non-profit's office.
                     One of our students was so enthusiastic about the HCD process, she offered to teach the class in the next semester.
                     The greatest feeling is seeing our students years after and hearing about how they continue to use the creative skillsets they learned in their every day.
                     One graduate uses what he learned in his work in a medical institution while another student talks about how she feels more empowered to be a creative when she otherwise would have felt disencouraged.
                     Warms my heart!

                 <p> I did a mini data visualization project that explored the patterns of Philippine immigration through the years.
                     I'm really passionate about Filipinos all over the world, and I wanted to trace out the numbers of Filipino diaspora members globally!
                     I used (sparse) data from phil.gov. I used R for analysis and preliminary visualization and Excel for extensive visualization.<br><br>

                 <p>Kai Labs is a project under Kai Entrepreneurship Wesleyan. I serve as the head "teacher" and coordinator.
                     It is a for-credit class taught by a team of 5 other student-teachers
                     wherein students get to work on real projects with faculty and staff clients to develop their
                     engineering, design and management skills. It mimics the real world and allows our students to interact
                     with real clients and solve problems at Wesleyan. <br><br>
                     We're currently going through the semester with the first iteration of our class. It's exciting and I'm hoping

                 <p> I wanted to create an app that made all our school's requests (rides, lost and found, event announcement) on our Facebook group more efficient.
                     At that time, I had to post my request on all 4 batch groups, hoping someone would answer. On user’s feeds, not everything is sent to the entire student body,
                     and my post may potentially just fade away. <br><br>
                     I sought an engineer to help me with the back-end and I designed the beginnings of the user interface and coded the front-end.<br><br>

                 <p> My university started using a new job search platform called <a href="http://joinhandshake.com">Handshake</a>
                     It was infinitely better than our previous platform, but was still rife with a few problems. I decided to
                     go through an exercise to redesign Handshake and came up with low-fi wireframes and high-fi mockups at the end.
                     I'm hoping this can somewhat benefit Handshake or inform a few of their designs in some way.<br><br>
